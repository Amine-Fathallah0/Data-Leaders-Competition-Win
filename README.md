 # Property Price Prediction 📈🏠

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict property prices based on various features. The work was carried out collaboratively by **Fathallah Amine**, **Mourad Kraiem**, and **Ahmed Amine Essid**.

## 📚 Project Overview

In this notebook, we explore a dataset containing real estate data and attempt to build predictive models for property prices using regression techniques. The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison between different regression algorithms

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

We used standard regression metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
